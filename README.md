### Architecture 
Core systems are denoted as Managers. They are accessed through related events. Their purpose is focused, they only implement logic for their intended goal. 

Denoted as controllers, higher level concepts, such as a store, are created from these prebuilt core systems. They simply assemble the systems that they need and invoke the correct events.
